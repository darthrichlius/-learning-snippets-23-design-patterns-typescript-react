# DESIGN PATTERN + TypeScript + React

## TL;DR

- Singleton
- Proxy (With Validation example)
- Prototype (With effective clone example)
- Observer (With Newsletter example)
- Mediator (Whit ChatRoom example)

## PURPOSE

This repository is part of a global initiative called `Learning Snippets`. It is a personal initiave which goal is to provide ready-to-use snippets or as a source of inspiration for better programming.

This repository contains a list of snippets around Design Patterns in the context of Javascript (TypeScript) and React.

This repository has been created as a personal memo to help me remember the various **23 patterns** and pick one depending on situations.

### PLUS-VALUE

It's certain there are dozens of good resources out there. Why this repository should get your attention and interest? First, this is not a commercial endeavor, so it's not built as such but as a personal project. If you are looking for the perfect edito, pass your way, there are better out there. that being said, this repository comes with some real benefits

- Complete GoF 23 patterns in the context of **TypeScript** and **React** for some parts
- All cases are **testable**. They come with a suite of test to make the run process simplier to understand
- A **local documentation** with parttern explaination, problem its solve, Solution is provided
  - As it is a local documentation benefits is that it's **transportable** and **editable**

### HOW TO CONSUME

- Each of the "Gang of Four" pattern has its own documentation to better understand the concept, why they example and be as clear as possible thanks to **examples** and **real-wold interpretation** or **programming usage**
- Each of the "Gang of Four" pattern has its own folder containing a **use case snippet code** and related **unit test** code
- Thank to link you can easily navigate and reach the code or the documentation

### SOURCES

This wiki is inpired from my book/web reading and research along with my personal experience. Below some resources, I used as inspiration, and you could use to dive deeper on each cases.
